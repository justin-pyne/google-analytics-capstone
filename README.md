# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Case Study
This is a record of my experience completing the Cyclistic Case Study, a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certification on Coursera. 
Technologies used: 
- Excel and SQL for data exploration, cleaning, and analysis.
- Tableau for data visualizations.


This project is also available on Notion, which I would recommend as a more readable format:
